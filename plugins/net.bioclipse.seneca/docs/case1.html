<h1>CASE Basics</h1>
<p>Computer-Aided Structure Elucidation is a method to find the constitutional structure
of a molecule, starting from the gross formula and NMR or MS spectra. The basic idea 
is simple: Generate structures of that composition and test them against data 
measured on the compound in question. The tricky bit is to do this effectivly and
efficiently, i. e. so that you get the right structure in a reasonable time. The 
sheer number of structure available for a typical formula makes this hard.</p>
<p>In order to do a structure elucidation (we call this "setting up a SENECA 
job"), you need to create a new 
Seneca job specification. Go to File->New->Seneca->Seneca Job for that. You will 
be asked for a name and a directory to create the job in. A new directory with 
the chosen name will be created and a file called name.sjs in it, which is open 
in a specialized editor. You need to add the required data to that file. The 
editor shows you three tabs in that. They are:<p>
<p><ul><li>General Data<br>
Here you need to set the general information about the structure to elucidate. 
This includes:
<ul><li>A name: You can chose this as you like</li>
<li>The gross formula: This must include hydrogens. You get this normally from mass spectrometry.</li>
<li>The carbon hydrogen count: You tell here how many CHX groups exist. DEPT spectroscopie 
gives you this information.</li>  
<li>Do aromaticity detection during run: Checking this will take time, but it increases 
the chance of hitting your structure in case it is aromatic.</li></ul>
<li>Generators<br>
Every run of SENECA needs a supply of candidate structure to test (the generating 
part mentioned above). For this, you need 
to choose one of the generators offered on this tab. These are:
<ul><li>Deterministic generator: SENECA is able to run with two different structure generators; the first is the
deterministic structure generator, which creates all possible constitutional
isomers for the given molecular formula.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li></ul></li>
<li>Scoring Functions<br>
</li></ul>
