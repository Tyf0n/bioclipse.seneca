<h1>CASE Basics</h1>
<p>Computer-Aided Structure Elucidation is a method to find the constitutional structure
of a molecule, starting from the gross formula and NMR or MS spectra. The basic idea 
is simple: Generate structures of that composition and test them against data 
measured on the compound in question. The tricky bit is to do this effectivly and
efficiently, i. e. so that you get the right structure in a reasonable time. The 
sheer number of structure available for a typical formula makes this hard.</p>
<p>In order to do a structure elucidation (we call this "setting up a SENECA 
job"), you need to create a new 
Seneca job specification. Go to File->New->Seneca->Seneca Job for that. You will 
be asked for a name and a directory to create the job in. A new directory with 
the chosen name will be created and a file called name.sjs in it, which is open 
in a specialized editor. You need to add the required data to that file. The 
editor shows you three tabs in that. They are:</p>
<p><ul><li>General Data<br>
Here you need to set the general information about the structure to elucidate. 
This includes:
<ul><li>A name: You can chose this as you like</li>
<li>The gross formula: This must include hydrogens. You get this normally from mass spectrometry.</li>
<li>The carbon hydrogen count: You tell here how many CHX groups exist. DEPT spectroscopie 
gives you this information.</li>  
<li>Do aromaticity detection during run: Checking this will take time, but it increases 
the chance of hitting your structure in case it is aromatic.</li></ul>
<li>Generators<br>
Every run of SENECA needs a supply of candidate structure to test (the generating 
part mentioned above). For this, you need 
to choose one of the generators offered on this tab. These are:
<ul><li>Deterministic Generator: SENECA is able to run with two different structure generators; the first is the
deterministic structure generator, which creates all possible constitutional
isomers for the given molecular formula. This is slow, but is bound to find 
the right structure.</li>
<li>Simulated Annealing Generator: This generator generates only some structures 
and is converging towards the best result. Much faster, but not guaranteeed to 
find the best result.</li>
<li>Simulated Annealing Generator (user configurable): Similar to the simulated 
annealing generator, but you can set some parameters. This requires some knowledge 
of the simulated annealing process.</li>
<li>Genetic Algorithm Generator: This tries to find the best result by converging 
towards it similar to simulated annealing, but using a different internal 
process.</li></ul>
<br>In general, you should try with the deterministic generator to see if it runs 
in a reasonable time. If not, try the stochastic generators.</li>
<li>Scoring Functions<br>
When candidate structures are produced, we need to score how good they are. A 
scoring function or a combination of scoring functions does this. In SENECA, 
you can choose these:
<ul><li>NMRShiftDB Scoring: This scores the structures according to a 13C spectrum. 
The spectrum will be peak picked if it is a continuous one. You probably need 
to check it still. Edit the generated file by opening it in the spectrum editor. 
This scoring function works well, but with large structures it might be 
lost with many structures, which are very similar.</li>
<li>Simple HOSE Code Scoring and Simple HOSE Code Scoring (using WCC): These are 
simpler versions of 13C scorings. The NMRShiftDB Scoring is to be prefered in 
almost always.</li>
<li>HMBC Soring: This does a scoring based on HSQC and HMBC spectra. Have a look 
at the file 2d.cml in example2 of the SENECA examples to see how the file you 
provide must look like. The file is no being processed.</li>
</ul>
<br>For all scorings, a configuration file needs to be supplied. You can drop it 
onto the field saying "Drop file here".
</li></ul>
