<h2>Writing a Scoring Function</h2>
<p>Scoring functions (also called judges) are contributed via the t.bioclipse.seneca.SenecaJudge 
extension. An example entry could look like this:</p>
<pre>   
   <extension
         point="net.bioclipse.seneca.SenecaJudge">
      <CASEJudge
            class="net.bioclipse.seneca.judge.WCCNMRShiftDBJudge"
            id="WCCNMRShiftDBJudge"
            name="WCCNMRShiftDBJudge"/>
   </extension>
</pre>
<p>The schema for the extension point can found <a href="../schema/SenecaJudge.exsd">here</a>. 
The judge class must implement the net.bioclipse.seneca.judge.IJudge interface. 
In most cases, the abstract class net.bioclipse.seneca.judge.Judge can be extended. The 
class should then implement the empty constructor and the methods createJudge, evaluate, 
getDescription, checkJudge and setData (see JavaDoc for explanation). The judge
should then show up in the editor and can be used.</p>
<p>Important considerations:
<ul>
<li>The evaluate method needs to return a score starting with 0 (very bad) to calcMaxScore() (very good).</li>
</ul>
</p>
